> Backing up your character images from Toyhou.se to Discord is one of many ways to insure that you don't lose anything in the event the website becomes corrupt or your characters somehow erase due to a bug.

Backing up your images from Toyhou.se to Discord sounds painstaking, especially if you have an unfathomable amount of art, but it's a rather simple (though tedious) process that you can do both on your PC and mobile (or tablet).

First you need to create yourself a server. This will be a private server for you and *only you* unless you'd like to share your art with others. I wouldn't recommend allowing others to join your server even if you trust them as you'll be posting your HQ, unwatermarked images into the channels.

Next you'll create a **private** category named after the Toyhou.se folder your character is in. If you have multiple AUs of your OC that you'd like to organise the photos for then name this category after your OC instead. While no one will be able to enter your server without an invite link, I'd still recommend privating each category for your own peace of mind.

Add a new channel to the category and name it after the character from the folder you're looking to back up the images for *or* the AU of the character your category is named after. You don't need to privatise the channel as the category will do it for you.

This is where it becomes tedious. Copy a HQ, unwatermarked image from your character's gallery. Make sure it's full sized and not the thumbnail. Paste it into the chat box on the Discord channel, switch back to your character's profile, copy the link address (*not* link text) from the credits, paste it into that chat box, and then press send (or enter, depending on how your Discord is configured). This should send the image to the channel along with the credit link. The image below doesn't show the example credit link as the credit link on the photo is actually just a link to a bigger version of it! However, social links and links that lead back to profiles will show up as links.

That's it! Continue doing that with every image until there's no more to back up from that character (or AU), then move onto the next one.

If you have multiple pieces of art of the same character from the same artist, I recommend pasting the credit link and then pasting all the art pieces into the same Discord message to save time.

To also save time if you have couple or group art of your OCs, I'd create a channel specifically for group or ship art so you don't have to post the same image in multiple channels.

If you'd rather that the credit link didn't automatically embed, place the link between `<>` brackets.
