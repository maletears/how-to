> Backing up to Google Sheets was the first online backup method I used, and something I still use when I purchase commissions. Keeping a workbook (the file that contains your sheets) or a sheet with you character's reference images can help keep everything organised, and can be sent to those you commission. Not just that, you can keep tabs on the art credits <i>and</i> the value of each piece (and the character as a whole).

> This tutorial is basic and only covers adding the images straight from Toyhou.se, without saving them to your device beforehand. If you're a visual person, feel free to follow along with the screenshots at the bottom of this page.

# STEP ONE: CREATION
First you need to create the workbook itself. I'm working on mobile but the best thing about Google Drive is that the interface for the majority of their processors are the same both online and on mobile.

Tap the button on the bottom right. On desktop, you may see a list of templates at the top of your screen instead. Just tap blank and that should open you a brand new workbook.

You'll automatically be sent to the first blank sheet called *Sheet1*. Feel free to click on that and either rename it to your character or, if you'll be using the whole workbook for your character, simply name the sheet after the AU or universe the collection of images will be set in. On desktop, you may need to tap the arrow next to where it says *Sheet1*, then tap rename.

# STEP TWO: FORMAT
To get a good look at the pictures, you need to make sure there's enough space to fit them. Select cells A1 to B13 and tap the button on the format bar that looks like two arrows inside a box. This should merge those cells to give us one big, image-sized box.

In the pictures I also may have missed a few steps, as you can see I have many more image-sized boxes. To get the same, select the image-sized box and hold down (or, on desktop, right click). This should being up a menu that contains normal copy-paste functions; select copy and there should be a dotted border around the box. Select C1 to D13, hold down (or, on desktop, right click) and select paste. Continue to do that until you're satisfied with the amount of boxes you have, but don't add any underneath row 13. We need row 14.

Once you're done, select A14 to B14. Merge those cells the same way you merged the image boxes. this will be the image credit box, which will include a hyperlink. Using the formula button in the bottom left isn't the simplest way to create a hyperlink, but it is the quickest in the long run.

Tap the formula button, scroll to where it says *Web*, then tap *Hyperlink*. Inside the brackets of the formula, put `"CREDITURL", "Credit"`.

Select the link box, bring up the copy-paste menu and then tap copy. Select C14 to D14, bring up the copy-paste menu and then tap paste. Do the same for each box you created a moment ago.

Go back to the image box and click the formula button again. Scroll to *Google* and then click *Image*. Between the brackets put `"IMAGEURL"`. You can copy-paste that into the other image boxes to save time backing up your art.

# STEP THREE: FILLING IT OUT
Find your image and open it in a new tab. Make sure the image is unwatermarked and copy the URL. Go back to your sheet and remove the *IMAGEURL* and paste the URL you've just copied between the quotation marks.

Your image should appear in the cell.

Next go back to your Toyhou.se and copy the link address (*not the link text!*) to the credit listed on the image. Go back to the sheet, remove the *CREDITURL* and paste the link address you just copied between the quotation marks.

Feel free to type in the name of the artist where it says *Credit*, or you could just leave it as it is.

And you're done!

# NOTES
- The image link is not a guaranteed permanent link. If you'd like to save your images to a cloud instead (i.e. Google Photos) and use the spreadsheet as a repository for credit, you can use the image method above or add the image directly from the drive. To do that on mobile tap these: the image box > plus sign in the top bar > image > image in cell.
- You can format the borders to the cells and the colours of the hyperlinks any way you want.
- To create another sheet formatted the same way, tap the sheet name in the bottom bar and then tap duplicate.
- To create another workbook formatted the same way, go back to your Google Sheets landing page, tap the three dots beside the title of your workbook, then tap make copy.
